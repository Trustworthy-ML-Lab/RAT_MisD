# RAT: Robustness Aware Training for Misclassfication Detection (MisD)
* This is the official repository for the paper "RAT: Boosting Misclassification Detection Ability without Extra Data".
The full codebase will be released once we finish the cleanup.
* We introduce robust radius into the field of Misclassification Detection (MisD) as a confidence score, which
is shown to be competitive across multiple benchmarks.
Additionally, we design two computation-efficient algorithms: RR-BS and RR-Fast for efficient robust radius estimation  for MisD task.
* Inspired by the importance of robust radius in MisD, we
further design a training method called Radius Aware
Training (RAT). The key idea is applies designed perturbation on input examples to encourage wrong and correct
inputs to be more separated in robust radius. We show this
training strategy enhances modelâ€™s ability to detect misclassification without performance loss. Compared with
previous approach, our RAT has a key advantage that it
does not need extra data.
* We conduct extensive empirical study on our method and
several baselines on the task of misclassification detection. Results show that our method outperforms the baselines over most settings, achieving up to 29.3% reduction
on AURC and 21.62% reduction in FPR@95TPR.
